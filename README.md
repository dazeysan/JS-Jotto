# JS-Jotto
Small standalone HTML/Javascript page to use as a helper when playing the game Jotto.

Just open the jotto.html file.
There is no online requirment and the file can be opened when offline as long as you saved it to your device.

The letters at the top of the page can be tapped to cycle from "Unknown"/(White) to "Not in Word"/(Red) to "Is in Word"/(Green) and then back to "Unknown".

Enter a word in the "Word" box and the number of correct letters in the "#" box then tap the "Add" button.

The word will be added to a list of words above the text boxes.  The color of each letter in the words will match and update based on the colors of the letters at the top of the page.

The # field for each word is editable in case the wrong number was given.  The script doesn't do anything with the #, it is purely there for your information.

The script doesn't try to figure out the word for you or make any suggestions.  It's more of a notepad that will help you figure out what letters are in the word by coloring them and letting you make changes without having to cross things out or erase them on paper.
